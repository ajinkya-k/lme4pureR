lme4pureR
=========

The penalized least squares (PLS) and penalized iteratively
reweighted least squares (PIRLS) algorithms from lme4, but written entirely
in pure R. The purpose is to clarify how PLS and PIRLS work without having 
to read through C++ code, and as a sandbox for trying out modified versions 
of PLS and PIRLS.
